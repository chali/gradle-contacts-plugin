 * list of all contacts that have the "owner" role (or no role). Module-Email is a common separated list of
 * contacts that want to be notified when changes are made to this module, they have to have the role of "notify"
 * (or no role). We're assuming that multiple owners are allowed, and we can just comma separate them.
